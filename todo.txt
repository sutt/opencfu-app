Takeaways

	nice clean python is:
		remove the print statements, 
		remove unnecessary if/elses
		testing comments
		nothing needed in ipython
		terse
		doesn't do every option conceivable, only whats atomically needed
		
	this allows us to "productionize" workspace
	
		into utils, main and test
		it's like cleaning up your workbench each night
		
	you know who else did this? Mac Cowell @SF_Tech_Museum
		get his work?
